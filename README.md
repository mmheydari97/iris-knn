# Iris Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors

### Dataset
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

### Finding optimum K
We should first find the best K for our algorithm in term of accuracy. then we train our classifier on the training set and
then calculate the accuracy on test set.
